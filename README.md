Famous words never written
===========================

An experiment in python, far from complete... working its way from python learning project to typographic posters.
It generates famous words never written by famous authors; based on text parsed from a text file containing a body of writing to work off. Using the most used word as a starting point and from three working out a string of words, based on the patterns found in the provided text.

usage: `python famouswords.py samples/file_to_read.txt`

This is still a very veyr side project, and hasnt been developed further for a while, but i hope to get to apoint where based ont he algorythms and parsed text I can produce a set of typograhic machine written posters, in the diction of the parsed author.
